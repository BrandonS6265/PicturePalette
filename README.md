PicturePalette
==============

A simple app to apply filters to images in your photo album.

The take photo button is disabled for simulator use as attempting to access the camera will crash the simulator.

If you are using simulator add photos to your album by accessing safari and saving images with a long press. You will also need a Facebook account to upload your filtered images.
